Linux
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
There are several distributions available, such as Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu.
Dominates over 96.4% of the server market share.
Renowned for its stability, security, and reliability.
Widely used as the main platform for Open Source Software development.
Kernel, Shell
Kernel: Manages system resources and hardware, serving as the core part of the operating system.
Shell: Acts as an intermediary between the user and the Kernel (popular shells include bash and zsh).
CLI vs GUI
CLI (Command Line Interface)
Users interact with the system by typing commands, mainly via the keyboard.

It is faster and allows for efficient task automation.

GUI (Graphical User Interface)
More user-friendly, primarily operated with a mouse, and ideal for beginners.

Though easier to use, it is generally slower than CLI and lacks robust automation features.

Git Bash
While Linux and MacOS come with built-in terminals, on Windows, Git Bash must be installed to provide a Linux-like CLI experience.
